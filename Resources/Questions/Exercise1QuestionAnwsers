1. Designing a Well-Formed XML File
The XML file for the library system has been designed and is well-formed.
It contains information for 10 books, with each book having the following elements: id,
title, writer, lix, pages, and times_lended.
Each book is enclosed within a <book> element,
and all book elements are nested within the <library> root element.

2. Root Element
The root element of the XML file is <library>.

3. Difference between Valid and Well-Formed XML
Well-formed XML:
An XML document is well-formed if it adheres to the syntax rules of XML.
This includes having a single root element, properly nested elements, closing tags,
and adhering to other XML syntax rules.

Valid XML:
In addition to being well-formed,
a valid XML document also conforms to a specific XML schema or Document Type Definition (DTD).
It means the document follows a predefined structure and content rules specified by the schema or DTD.

5. Parsing XML in Java
To parse XML files in Java, you can use the Java API for XML Processing (JAXP).
The main packages you would typically use are:

javax.xml.parsers:
Provides classes to parse XML documents.
org.w3c.dom: Defines the DOM (Document Object Model) interfaces for accessing and manipulating XML documents.
org.xml.sax: Defines the SAX (Simple API for XML) interfaces for event-based XML parsing.
You can use classes like DocumentBuilder or SAXParser from javax.xml.parsers package to parse XML files and obtain a DOM or SAX representation of the document.
Then, you can use classes from org.w3c.dom or org.xml.sax packages to navigate and extract data from the XML document.
